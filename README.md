HD Associate Schedule Downloader Chrome Extension

This is an extension I wrote that reads the schedule information from the mythdhr schedule and formats it for downloading
as an Outlook CSV or ICAL file.

There are fields in the extension options where you can specify the file name, the event name (what the work shift shows up as on your
calendar), and the location (for getting location based alerts re: traffic, when to leave).
